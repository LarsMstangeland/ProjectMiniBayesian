When constructing a Fano tree we see that the number of unkown words in the nodes could be skwewed. Meaning a tree of i words could after the first yes/no split condition away either set 1 or set 2 of possible words. Where the size of sets differ. This becomes a problem when in the average case we wish to gain the most information from a splitt.
